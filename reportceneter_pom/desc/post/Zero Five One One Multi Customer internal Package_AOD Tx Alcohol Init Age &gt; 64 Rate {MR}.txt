AOD Tx Alcohol Init Age > 64 Rate {MR} = Patients AOD Tx Alcohol Init Age > 64 Num {MR}/Patients AOD Tx Alcohol Init Age > 64 Den {MR}
AOD Tx Alcohol Init Age > 64 Rate {MR} is the percentage of patients, aged 65 years and older, with a new episode of alcohol abuse or dependence who initiated treatment within 14 days of the diagnosis. This excludes patients who used hospice services during the measurement year. This measure is based on results returned by the Rules Engine for the Alcohol and Drug Depen Tx Alcohol Init Mcd Adlt rule. Sources: Based on NCQA Measure ID - IET; NQF (endorser); NCQA (owner) 2018
