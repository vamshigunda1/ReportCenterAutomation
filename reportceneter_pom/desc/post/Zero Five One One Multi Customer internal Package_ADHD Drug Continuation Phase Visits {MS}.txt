ADHD Drug Continuation Phase Visits {MS} identifies the Rules Engine measure that calculates the percentage of children, aged 6 to 12 years, who had an ambulatory prescription dispensed for an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication and remained on that medication for at least 10 months, and who had at least one follow-up visit with a practitioner during the 30-day initiation phase and two follow-up visits with a practitioner during the 9-month period following the initiation phase. This excludes children who had an ADHD prescription dispensed within 4 months prior to the start of the initiation phase, had less than 210 days supply of an ADHD medication dispensed during the 10-month measurement period, had an acute mental health or substance abuse inpatient stay during the measurement period, or had a history of narcolepsy anytime prior to or during the measurement period, based on claims included in the database. This subset returns results based on the ADHD Drug Continuation Phase Visits Medicaid Child rule measure.
