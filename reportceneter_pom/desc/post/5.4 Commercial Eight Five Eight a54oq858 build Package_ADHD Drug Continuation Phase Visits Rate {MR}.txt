ADHD Drug Continuation Phase Visits Rate {MR} = Patients ADHD Rx Continu Phase Visits Num {MR}/Patients ADHD Rx Continu Phase Visits Den {MR}
ADHD Drug Continuation Phase Visits Rate {MR} is the number of children, aged 6 to 12 years, who were on an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drug and remained on that drug for 7 out of 10 months, and who had at least one follow-up visit during the 30-day initiation phase and two follow-up visits during the 9-month continuation phase, expressed as a percentage of the total number of children, aged 6 to 12 years, who were on an ADHD drug and remained on that drug for at least 10 months. It excludes children who were on an ADHD drug within 4 months prior to the initiation phase, had less than 210 days supply of an ADHD drug dispensed during the measurement period, had an acute mental health or chemical dependency inpatient stay during 10 months following the start of the index prescription, or had a history of narcolepsy anytime prior to or during the measurement period, based on claims included in the database. This measure is based on results returned by the Rules Engine for the ADHD Drug Continuation Phase Visits Medicaid Child rule.

Patients ADHD Rx Continu Phase Visits Num {MR} is the unique count of children who were prescribed an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication and remained on an ADHD drug for 7 months out of a 10-month period, aged 6 to 12 years from ten months prior to the beginning of the measurement year to ten months prior to the end of the measurement year, who had at least two outpatient, intensive outpatient, or partial hospitalization follow-up visits with a practitioner from 31 to 300 days following the start of the index prescription. It excludes children who had an ADHD drug dispensed within 4 months prior to the initiation phase, had an acute mental health or chemical dependency inpatient stay during the ten months following the start of the index prescription, or had a history of narcolepsy anytime prior to or during the measurement period, based on claims included in the database.

ADHD Drug Continuation Phase Visits {MS}
ADHD Drug Continuation Phase Visits {MS} identifies the Rules Engine measure that calculates the percentage of children, aged 6 to 12 years, who had an ambulatory prescription dispensed for an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication and remained on that medication for at least 10 months, and who had at least one follow-up visit with a practitioner during the 30-day initiation phase and two follow-up visits with a practitioner during the 9-month period following the initiation phase. This excludes children who had an ADHD prescription dispensed within 4 months prior to the start of the initiation phase, had less than 210 days supply of an ADHD medication dispensed during the 10-month measurement period, had an acute mental health or substance abuse inpatient stay during the measurement period, or had a history of narcolepsy anytime prior to or during the measurement period, based on claims included in the database.
